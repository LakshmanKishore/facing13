# Facing 13

Facing 13 is a puzzle game where you help Tessa overcome her fear of the number 13 (triskaidekaphobia). Every 13 seconds, a "13" block appears, increasing Tessa's fear meter. To stop it, match the 3x3 block pattern in the 5x5 grid below, lowering her fear. Clear all the block 13s to help Tessa overcome her fear.

This game was created for the js13kgames competition in 2024.

### Controls

Laptop: Swipe with the mouse cursor to swap blocks.
Mobile: Swipe on the screen to move and match blocks.

Match the patterns before Tessa's fear meter fills up and game over!
